# polyhedra
Each of these files creates a tile.

The tiles have holes for magnets.

If correctly installed, the magnets guide the user to assembling the polyhedron properly.

Using magnets, as opposed to gluing, allows the user to assemble and disassemble the polyhedron repeatedly.

Also, the magnets distribute any errors in the tiles evenly, so that they do not accumulate and become obvious (which happens with gluing)

Another idea is to omit the magnets and use velcro instead. This seems especially suitable for the creation of large, foam versions of these tiles that could be cut using a jig. (if you make one, please send a picture! I'd love to see it)
