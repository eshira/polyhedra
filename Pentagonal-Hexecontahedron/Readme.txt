Playing around with a tile piece to create a Pentagonal hexecontahedron

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_hexecontahedron

Catalan solid
Dual of snub dodecahedron

60 faces (irregular pentagon)
150 edges
92 vertices

Dihedral angle: 153 degrees 10' 43"

File is a mess (openscad is not friendly to this sort of thing)

Ideas:
3d print in different colors
Decoupage outside or paint
Mill out of wood with a v-carve bit matching the needed angle (probably would have to be custom)
